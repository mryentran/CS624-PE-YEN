This mobile app program is just simply to display some info text about my name, program and university onto the screen. The app does not require any input at the moment but all the information is hardcoded. The purpose is for me to practice using React native components like View, Text, and StyleSheet to render this information appropriately and give them certain styling and arrangement.
